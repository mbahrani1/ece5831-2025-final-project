# Breast Cancer Histopathology Images Classification  

**Abstract**  
This project applies deep learning techniques to the classification of breast cancer histopathology images using the **BreaKHis** and **BACH (ICIAR 2018)** datasets. By integrating contrast enhancement, class balancing, and attention-based convolutional neural networks, the project evaluates how these techniques improve multi-class classification performance in digital pathology.

## Code Structure
The project implementation is organized into two Jupyter notebooks:

- **`project_obj_1.ipynb`**  
  → BreaKHis dataset pipeline (tumor subtype classification)

- **`project_obj_2.ipynb`**  
  → BACH dataset pipeline (four-class tissue classification)

Each notebook contains data preprocessing, model training, validation, testing, and performance visualization.
